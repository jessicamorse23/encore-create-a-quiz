# encore-create-a-quiz
Challenge 4

## Description

The stated goal of the 4th challenge is to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. The motivation for the project is to become familiar with the sort of questions that might be offered on similar quizes during the interview process. In this challenge, I learned more about using JavaScript syntax and functions to create a dynamic application.
